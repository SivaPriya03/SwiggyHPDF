    The task is to clone the [Twitter Home page](https:www.twitter.com) 
            and the search results :https://twitter.com/search?q=aadhaar using ReactJS


#To install React app 
   Run the following commands 
        npm install create-react-app
        create-react-app <Project name>

Since we use material ui and font  and material ui icons we have to install itby running the following commands
    Material ui Version 1
        npm install --save material-ui@next  
        npm install --save font-awesome
        npm install --save material-ui-icons
 For navigating between pages we use React Router DOM
      npm install --save react-router-dom

Then copy all the files and folders in src folder
      Change ICOn and title in the index.html page resided in public repo


#Hurrah You reached the FINAL STEP!!  
     Run >npm start
  To start the server
